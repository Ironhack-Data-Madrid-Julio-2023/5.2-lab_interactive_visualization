    "    Learn about iPyWidgets.\n",
    "    Introduce the interact decorator.\n",
    "    Create visualizations with interactive sliders.\n",
    "    Create visualizations with interactive drop-down boxes.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we covered how to make interactive, Javascript-based visualizations using Python and the plotly and cufflinks libraries. This provided us with the ability to hover over the plot points in the chart to see the values, and it also enabled us to include and exclude groups from the visualization by simply clicking on them in the legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interactivity doesn't have to stop there. In this lesson, we are going learn how to make our visualizations even more interactive via the use of widgets such as sliders, drop-down boxes, check boxes, and text boxes. These widgets are going to control aspects of the information that get passed to our visualizations. Using these widgets to change values is going to cause the visualizations to change themselves. We will be using these widgets to extend the interactivity of charts generated with plotly and cufflinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate widgets into our visualizations, we will need to ensure that we have the iPyWidgets library installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ pip install ipywidgets\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also go ahead and import everything we are going to need for this lesson."

Widgets can help us with this by allowing us to quickly and easily view different numbers of bins without having to manually input them into our code and regenerate the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the interact decorator to create a slider widget where we specify a range of bins (from as few as 8 to as many as there are unique tenures). Then, we can simply define a hist function (it really doesn't matter what you name it) that accepts the dynamic number of bins and plugs them in to a plotly histogram so that the number of bins in the visualization updates as you modify the values with the slider."
